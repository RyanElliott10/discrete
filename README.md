### News

* Perform two things on each article:
    1. Determine which securities are mentioned/talked about
        * This will vary based on how the news API works
    2. Extract the pertinent parts about each ticker and perform sentiment
       analysis on them
        * Custom transfer learning model
        * Train model on next word prediction, then remove the final layer(s)
          and perform sentiment analysis
        * Or simply use word2vec and avoid transfer learning
* Or we could just boil news down to a sentiment for a given stock and use that
  as a small indicator paired with financial data

* [Stock News API](https://stocknewsapi.com)

### Financial Data

* [Transformer with Time2Vector](https://towardsdatascience.com/stock-predictions-with-state-of-the-art-transformer-and-time-embeddings-3a4485237de6)

## Model
![Model Architecture](https://github.com/RyanElliott10/discrete/blob/main/docs/img/architecture.svg)

## Todo
* [x] Research viable output representations
	* Just do the price difference/percent from the last day
	* It uses the last close as the principal for each prediction; $y_0$ is independent of $y_1$
	* Granted, this (almost) defeats the purpose of using a transformer
		* With $x_N$ representing a close price of $25
		* $y_0$ would predict +1%, $25.25
		* $y_1$ would be predict +2.3%, $25.575
* [x] Figure out how we would go about predicting short squeeze events
	* Would we have a simple indicator saying "yes, it will close higher and it'll be a short squeeze"?
